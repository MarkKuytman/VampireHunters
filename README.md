## Project Overview

**Vampire Hunters** is a thrilling game inspired by the popular game *Vampire Survivors*. Our project was developed as part of our coursework at HAN University of Applied Sciences using the Java programming language, the school's proprietary game engine, Yeager, and our newly gained knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Game Concept

In **Vampire Hunters**, players face off against three different types of enemies. As you defeat enemies, they drop little blue crystals that serve as experience points (XP). Collecting these XP crystals allows players to unlock one of three different weapons, each offering a unique way to combat the vampire threat.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Game Engine:** Yeager (HAN University of Applied Sciences' in-house engine)

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a backup and for safekeeping of the **Vampire Hunters** project. The main development took place in a private repository owned by one of our project members.
